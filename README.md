# Utsa Poddar — Data & Numerical Simulations

Hi there! I'm Utsa Poddar, a physics-trained data enthusiast who loves turning numbers and equations into insights. My background in classical mechanics and numerical methods feeds into my passion for data analysis, modeling, and clean code.

## ✨ Focus areas

- **Physics & simulations:** building numerical models to solve differential equations and simulate physical systems.
- **Data analysis & SQL:** extracting actionable insights from data with Python (pandas, NumPy) and SQL.
- **Continuous learning:** preparing to pursue a master’s degree while honing skills in data engineering and analytics.

## 🛠 Tech stack

Python • MATLAB • SQL • Jupyter Notebook • pandas • NumPy • matplotlib • Git/GitHub
